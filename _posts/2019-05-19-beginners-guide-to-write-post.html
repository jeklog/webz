<p>Blogs are the best way to generate traffic to your business. With the incoming of other easy platforms for sharing
    your knowledge like Video or Audio, you might think that blogging is dead. But in reality, blogging has become
    the most important aspect of any business.</p>

<p>And there are reasons for writing blog posts for any business.</p>

<h2>More than 90% of the organic traffic to small businesses, comes from blog posts.</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290894">Entrepreneur.com</a>, Blog Posts is the best way
    in which a business can drive traffic.</p>

<h2>Blog Posts are the cheapest way to transfer your expertise on a topic</h2>

<p>Being an entrepreneur, you are the best expert in the respective industry you are working in as you working on the
    same thing everyday. You can share your expertise by writing a blog post. You don't need some kind of costly
    instrument for creating a blog post. You can easily do it on your own computer.</p>

<h2>It is easy to change the content and update.</h2>

<p>You might have seen, <kbd>Updated 20..</kbd> in many of the blog posts that you read. This is because it is easy to
    change the content when it is written in the form of words. Now consider changing something in a video. You will
    have to create the whole video again to update the content.</p>

<p>Writing a Blog Post is not just thinking about something and writing about it. There is a well-defined structure
    that most of the professionals use out there. In this blog post, we are going to look into that structure in some
    detail.</p>

<p>The first step is to come up with blog post ideas. I personally maintain a Google sheet where I write all my blog
    post ideas and keep on marking them done, once I am done writing that post. This way I keep track of everything. You
    can also maintain such sheet or maybe write it somewhere for your use. This way I am never short of ideas on what to
    write about.</p>

<p><strong>But how do you come up with the list of ideas anyway? You might ask.</strong></p>

<p>Well, first of all, you have to write very <kbd>newbie</kbd> articles related to your business. For example: If you
    are in the finance industry, you can write about what documents are required to get that loan, how to pay your
    bills, how to structure your budget and not get trap in a dept.</p>

<p>Once you have written on all those topics, you can start writing on other topics. Writing down all those topics will
    help to generate authenticity for your blog in the eyes of the reader. They come to know that you have everything
    that they want to read. There is a possibility that they might end up being your customer for the same reason.</p>

<h2>Know your industry</h2>

<p>Now that you have written about all the basic topics, you can start about the new hot things going on in the
    industry, these are the topics which interest most of the people on the social media and grab their attention. To
    accomplish this task you need to know the industry in a bit of detail.</p>

<h2>Feel the pain of the customer</h2>

<p>If you are a business owner, you must have analyzed your customer data and felt like nearly 40% of the people in the
    funnel are getting stuck on step 4 of the procedure and its pretty hard to solve it using technology. What you
    can do is to write a blog post and next time anyone who gets stuck on the step will get an automatic notification to
    read the post.</p>

<p>You can ask your customer about the things that they want to read about. You can also go to your competitor's blog
    and see what they are writing about and share your own expertise on the topic( But never copy).</p>

<h2>Read customer reviews</h2>

<p>Most of the business owners get this thing wrong, they get so caught up building things that they stop thinking of
    reading the customer reviews and knowing how the customers are responding to there products.</p>

<p>
    <blockquote>Always hear to your customer but believe only on data.</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Whenever customer shares some feedback always try to dig as much as possible try to validate the user feedback using
    the data that you have. This way you can save yourself from working on a solution for which there was never a
    problem.</p>

<h2>Check for trending keywords</h2>

<p>Another important thing that you can do is keyword research. You can go to any of the tools like Google keyword
    planner, Bing webmaster tool or UberSuggest to do some initial keywords related to your niche.</p>

<p><strong>We always recommend going with a keyword having low difficulty and high search volume.</strong></p>

<p>Now that you know the topic on which you are going to write, start by creating an outline of the topic. This is the
    time when you can pick up your paper and pen and start creating an outline.</p>

<p>
    <blockquote>
        Posts with bullet points gets far more traction than a post without bullet points.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>Create bullet points of all the topics that you discuss in your post.</p>

<p>Another good idea is to find quotes around a topic. Quotes are the best way to attract the reader's attention.</p>

<h2>The Deep work</h2>

<p>
    <blockquote>
        There's always a need for people who go deep.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>I recently, read a book called, The deep work (I recommend it), in which the writer recommends the readers to go as
    deep as possible on any topic in life. Going deep always helps.</p>

<p>Apparently, for the same reason, Google loves the <a
        href="https://seoleal.com/2019/05/14/keyword-stemming-in-long-tail-seo.html">posts with more than 3000 words</a>
    and gives them extra credits for being long.</p>

<p>Your post should always be giving the answer to these 3 Ws and an H also a famous post by <a
        href="https://www.thoughtco.com/journalists-questions-5-ws-and-h-1691205">Richard Nordquist</a>. Although he
    wrote the post in term of journalism, we can use it for blog posts as well.</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>

<p>Answers who is the post for. You must tell who is the post for. For example, we wrote in the headline itself, that
    the post is for beginners. Mostly it doesn't stop advanced people from reading the post.</p>

<h2>What?</h2>

<p>Answer what the post is about. This must be done in the first two paragraphs only, just restate your headline in a
    different way and you are good to go.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>Not that important for the blog posts in general, but if you are writing news post for the finance industry, you must
    state when did the government come with the following policy.</p>

<h2>Where?</h2>

<p>If the post is affected by geography, don't forget to mention. It's very important.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Most of the professional blogger try to do it in the first paragraph. It answers why the topic is important.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>This is the part which you should answer in the end. Also, this is the most important part of the post, so never
    hurry. Most of the bloggers answer all the questions very well and in the end, when it comes to answer this
    question, they write anything. Never compromise on this one. This is the one thing for which you started to write
    anyway.</p>

<p>After making an outline, you can start writing your post. We will discuss the process from start to end.</p>

<h2 id="headlines">Write a non-resistable headline</h2>

<p>The first and foremost thing that you write in a blog post is the headline. The headline is the most important part
    of your <a href="/seo/">Search Engine Optimization( SEO)</a> process. This title is visible to anyone who is
    searching for a keyword on the search engine. If your headline is not great your CTR would be low. We wrote a <a
        href="https://seoleal.com/2019/05/08/increase-CTR-by-38-percent.html">smart tactic guide</a> which you can
    follow to write good and clickable titles.</p>

<p>There are some tricks that you can use to make your headlines better.</p>

<h3>1. Write on a trending topic</h3>

<p>I know we have discussed this before But this is such an important topic that people miss so much, that I have to
    write it again. Your headline can be easily derived from an ongoing trending topic. People tend to read about these
    topics and eager to read more about the topic.</p>

<p>You can make use of this knowledge and keep an eye on Twitter and FaceBook for trending topics in your niche. Also
    use Amazon Book reviews for the books in your niche to generate an headline.</p>

<h3><strike>Steal</strike> Copy Smartly</h3>

<p>You can steal the headlines from the professional bloggers in the industry. But don't be too naive and copy the whole
    thing as it is. Be smart and make changes accordingly. </p>

<h3>Use some tools</h3>

<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker">Title Maker</a> tool by portent for generating ideas
    for your headlines. Just put in the topic on which you want to write on, and the tool will generate topic titles for
    you.</p>

<h3>Make it smaller</h3>

<p>Once you are done with everything, try to make the title smaller. <a
        href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag">MOZ</a> recommends to keep it under 60 Character and more than 50
    characters. Otherwise your title will not be visible on the search engine like Google.</p>

<h3>Never lie</h3>

<p>Never lie in the headline and promise something which is not achievable. Always deliver the content which is said to
    be delivered in the headline. Othewise readers will click on the headline will read the content in the try to find
    the answer, which they never will and return back increasing your bounce rate.</p>

<h3>Use Adjectives</h3>

<p>According to the headline guide by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/headline-writing-tips">Marina
        Barayeva</a>, we should use strong adjectives while writing the headlines of a post. One good example of this
    is:</p>

<h4>A <kbd>one and only</kbd> guide for...</h4>

<p>These adjectives will help to gain more traction for your blog post.</p>

<h3>Make use of numbers</h3>

<p>According to the same guide, try to use odd numbers in the post headlines. According to a study by backlinko, posts
    with odd number converts by more numbers as compared to the posts with even numbers. This type of tactic plays with
    the subconscious mind of the reader. Odd numbers give a sense of exploration to the reader. When they see a odd
    number they tend to ask in the mind, Why, why an odd number( Why 5, Why 7). To find the answer they end up clicking
    the link.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to write good headlines, let's discuss the topic on how to write good body with good entry
    paragraphs.
</p>

<h2>The Body: First few paragraphs</h2>

<p>This represents the first few paragraphs of your post. In these paragraphs you can bind the reader to your post.</p>

<h3>Ask few questions</h3>

<p>Just start by asking a few questions. For example:</p>

<p><strong>Do you want to make extra 100 dollars this month?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you want to learn this new skill?</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time the answer to this question, should be yes.</p>

<h3>Think is terms of the reader</h3>

<p>Think about what your reader might be thinking at the moment and convey the same thing as words.</p>

<h3>Throw some numbers</h3>

<p>Its always a good thing to back your topic with numbers( with links). For example,</p>

<p>
    <blockquote>According to this( the link) research 50% of the people living in given area, use drugs on daily basis.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Make a promise and deliver on it!</h3>

<p>Make a promise but never forget to deliver on it. For example:</p>

<p>
    <blockquote>
        After reading this post you would be able to ...
    </blockquote>
</p>

<h2>The Real Body</h2>

<p>This is the part in which you start answering the <kbd>How</kbd> of the post. Be aware to give everything that you
    have in this part. Never hold back anything.</p>

<h3>Use Sub-headings</h3>

<p>Make use of different subheadings. This makes your article far more readable. This is also good for the people who
    just want to skim through the article quickly.</p>

<h3>Write small paragraphs</h3>

<p>If you read about blogging and SEO, you must have read, Neil Patel's blog. If you take a closer look, He write very
    small paragraphs. Most of them are just 1-2 sentences.</p>

<p>After seeing the success that he had with his blog, you can start following this small detail. This small detail can
    bring you far more readers than you can think of.</p>

<h3>Follow a format</h3>

<p>Some people never follow a format. Somewhere they are using h4 and suddenly they start using bold text instead of
    headings. Consistency is the key to everything. If you keep on changing the order, reader will get confused and will
    move away from the page.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>This is the part which represents last two-three paragraphs of the post.</p>

<h3>Conclude</h3>

<p>Never leave the post without a conclusion. This is the part where you can recape everything that you have discussed
    in few words.</p>

<h3>Call to Action</h3>

<p>If you want to ask something from the people or want them to do something, this is the part where you want the people
    to ask it for. If you want the people to share the post, never hesitate to ask. People share more when you ask them
    to share the post, they comment more if you ask them to comment.</p>

<h2>After the end</h2>

<p>You also have to perform certain tasks after completing the post. Following are the basic operations which you can
    perform.</p>

<h3>Proofread</h3>

<p>This is the most important part of the post. People tend to make mistakes while writing. Even I make a lot of
    mistakes. You can avoid all of them by proofreading it. Just go through the blog post once and you will be good to
    go.</p>

<h3>Use <a href="https://grammarly.com">Grammeraly</a></h3>

<p>There is nothing bad then reading a post with bad grammar. Make use of tools like grammarly.</p>

<h3>Do some SEO related things</h3>

<p>Read our <a href="/seo/">posts related to SEO</a> for this. Its very important to get readers from Search Engines.
</p>

<h2>After publishing</h2>

<p>Writing the post is not the only thing. Do these tasks to get the readers for your post.</p>

<h3>Share</h3>

<p>Share the post as much as possible. Share on all the social media channels. You can drive a lot of traffic from all
    these channels.</p>

<h3>Read and answer comments</h3>

<p>Always keep an eye on the comment section and answer the questions which pop up in the comment section.</p>

<p>Writing a blog post can be tricky. But if you follow the discussed guidelines you can succeed in the process.</p>
