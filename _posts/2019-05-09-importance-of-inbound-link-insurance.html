<p>
    <blockquote>
        Domains are the new real estate.
    </blockquote>
</p>

<p>Getting backlinks from websites with high domain authority is very tough. Even when you get that high-quality
    backlink, after sometime, if there is no update to the website and the website has not been opened for a long time,
    the page will start disappearing from the search engine.</p>

<h2>The strategy of link insurance</h2>

<p>The strategy is to link your internal pages as well. This way you are shouting to the search engine that this link is
    important and you have to show it to the people.</p>

<p>The value of the link is defined by the collective support system and these things rely on each other. For example,
    if a website with good domain authority backlinks your website, your link will show up higher in the search engine
    ranking. Stronger the backlink, more traffic will it give it to your website.</p>

<h2>Getting more number of links</h2>

<p>More the number of links to the page more freshness it has. Even when some of the links are going out of search
    engines, more important are still left behind for you. Linking to your internal pages will send a signal to the
    search engine that the given link is a fresher and is needed to be raised in the search engine ranking as one
    more page is pointing to it now.</p>
