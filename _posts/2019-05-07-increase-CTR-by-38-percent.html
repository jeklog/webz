<p>Not a long ago, I was going through a post on backlinko.com, where the explained on how to increase the Click through
    rate of a link by using some psychological approaches. According to the post, Hubspot and Outbrain, came together
    and analyses millions of titles and come to one single conclusion.</p>

<p>It won't take more than a few seconds to apply this in your blog. You can use this tactic to produce awesome results
    and create more search traffic for your website.</p>

<h2>And the answer is, <strong>brackets</strong>: () or []</h2>

<p>Brackets get 38% more clicks than a title with no brackets. Well I tried to make use of this strategy. So from now on
    I am going to make use of these brackets in all the posts that I am going to write.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I also feel like even I tend to click on the links with title having brackets in them.</p>

<h2>Let's see some good examples</h2>

<p>I am fond of reading tech blogs as they are needed in my day to day work. I was trying to learn something related to
    aggregate in MongoDb. So I decided to search for it. I went through some of the links but the one which caught my
    eye was the following.</p>

<strong>How to use Mongo aggregates( with ease).</strong>

<p>This link was shouting at me to click on it. I went throught the post, although it was a great post but the title was
    what brought me to the link at the first place.</p>

<h2>Non-blog websites</h2>

<p>This thing also works on non-blog websites, for example if someone is selling a white board on ebay and has one of
    these two titles,</p>

<strong>White Board</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>white Board (4*3)</strong>

<p>Which one of them are you likely to choose on any day. I would personally go with second one. So will be the most of
    us.</p>

<h2>Improving search engine ranking</h2>

<p>As more and more people are going to click on the post and google recording each click, will tell google to put the
    link in a better position.</p>

<h2>How to use this strategy?</h2>

<p>Now that you know the tactic, you have to make use of it. But before going to your blog and filling each and every
    page title with brackets, there a few things that you might want to look into.</p>

<p>The words used the brackets should tell more about the link, it should be answering a sigle question. What will I see
    when I will open this link.</p>

<strong>For example:</strong>
<br>

<p>Make use of some of these.</p>

<p><strong>(Video)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Last call)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(With examples)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(and some extra reward.)</strong></p>

<p>There are so many things that you can create in there. You just need to be a little creative on that front.</p>

<p>Please share your comments, if you have tried this strategy before. Also, let us know about the results.</p>
